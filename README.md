# Critical Network Incident Notification Flow Remediation


This README details the remediation of an existing ServiceNow workflow to ensure proper alerting for critical priority network incidents. It outlines the steps taken to configure the flow, ensure notifications reach the correct team, and validate the solution. Additionally, it includes an analysis of how an AI agent could further enhance the incident notification system.

## Configure the Flow Properly - Implementation Step 1
The 'Kura Workload 1' workflow was remediated to correctly trigger notifications for critical network incidents.

The existing workflow was renamed to 'Critical Network Incident Notification' for clarity and business-friendliness.

The notification trigger within the flow was modified to activate when an incident meeting the following criteria is detected:

* **Category: Network**

* **Impact: High**

* **Urgency: High**

* **Priority: Critical** (This is obtained from the High Impact and High Urgency fields)

## Ensure Notifications Reach the Proper Team Implementation Step 2
To guarantee the network operations team receives timely alerts for critical incidents, a new email address was created and configured.

It was identified that the Network Operations group lacked a dedicated email address.

A new email address, networkingoperators@example.com, was created for this group.

The notification within the 'Critical Network Incident Notification' workflow was configured to send alerts directly to the Network Operations group via their newly established email address.

## Test and Validate the Working System Implementation Step 3
Testing was conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the updated workflow.

Test incidents were created with the 'Network' category and 'Critical' priority.

It was confirmed that notifications were successfully sent to networkingoperators@example.com, as evidenced by entries in the ServiceNow outbox table.

The fixed workflow is now expected to prevent SLA breaches by ensuring the Network Operations team is promptly alerted to critical network incidents, facilitating timely resolution.

# AI Scenario
Hypothetical Scenario: Your company operates globally across multiple time zones. Critical incidents often occur outside business hours when senior engineers aren't available. The current escalation process follows a rigid hierarchy that doesn't account for engineer expertise, current availability, or incident complexity, leading to prolonged resolution times.

An AI agent could significantly enhance this incident notification and escalation system beyond the current fixed workflow by introducing intelligent routing and dynamic response management:

## Intelligent Routing: ##
 An AI agent could analyze the incident's details and cross-reference them with a database of network engineer profiles. Instead of a hierarchy, it could identify the most qualified network engineer for that specific type of incident. Simultaneously, it would check real-time engineer availability to ensure the notification goes to someone who can immediately respond.

## Consideration of Time Zones and Current Workloads: ##
The AI could integrate with global time zone data and network engineer work schedules. If a critical incident occurs outside typical business hours in one region, the AI could automatically identify qualified and available engineers in active time zones, minimizing delays. 

## Learning from Historical Resolution Patterns: ##
The AI agent could be trained on historical incident data, including resolution times, the network engineers involved, the steps taken, and the incident's complexity. Through machine learning, it could identify patterns that lead to faster resolutions. This continuous learning would allow the system to adapt and improve its routing decisions over time, which would help to optimize future incident remediations, as well as shorten downtime.
